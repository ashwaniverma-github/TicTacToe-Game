# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game built using React.

## Description

Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols (usually 'X' and 'O'). The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

This project implements the game logic using React hooks to manage state and components for rendering the game board and squares.

## Features

- Play against another player or a simple bot AI.
- Real-time status display indicating the current player's turn and game outcome.
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.
- # Multiplayer mode (coming soon).

## Installation

To run the game locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
